  	<p class="text-indent"><br><br>Business schools’ excellence depends on the extent of interaction students have with industries, the extent of exposure to the outside business world and the depth of learning taking place in the campus. The opportunities given to students to nurture their creativity, organizing skills and application of the concepts for real world scenario are also important for the progress of any business school. Application of digital tools, cross border experience with multi ethnic groups and practical experience of entrepreneurial skills are also critical. I am glad that, VIT Business School is moving ahead in the right direction in reaching the pinnacle in all these areas. Active management student clubs, conduct of continuous co & extracurricular competitions, simulation exercises, case analysis, outbound training sessions with social interactions are the integral part of VITBS. Having e-portfolio and developing the digital footprint and use of digital social media in every facet of management are part of VITBS students’ campus life. VITBS moulds the students to be industry ready, with soft skill programmes and communication training as a part of their curriculum. The academic rigor at VITBS gives strong foundation of concepts in management to students. Given an opportunity our students will excel and prove themselves to be responsible leaders of the 21st century business world. <br> 

I wish them all the very best. <br><br>
